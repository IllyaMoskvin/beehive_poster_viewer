        <strong>To understand where we are,
        we must remember where
        we’ve been.</strong> In this nighttime
        scene, we find communities
        living as though their lives
        depend on the land around them.
        The night sky, undisturbed by
        satellites or airplanes, is filled with constellations, used
        for orientation, navigation, and storytelling.

          The coal we use today
          in the US to supply
          over 50% of our
          electricity began its life
          over 300 million years
          ago, as giant plants decomposing
          and compressing in an ancient swamp. The
          decendents of these ancestors are still around todaywe
          know them as Ferns, Horsetails, and Club Mosses.
          The sunlight stored in those ancient fossils through
          photosynthesis is what we capture when we burn coalover
          10,000 years of compressed solar energy, consumed
          in a flash! And coal still does today what those
          plants did all those millenia
          ago- like a giant brita filter,
          it sucks heavy metals and
          toxins out of water and soil,
          sequestering them in the
          ground forever.

          <p>The Appalachian mountains
          are some of the oldest mountains
          on earth, and they are incredibly
          special. After massive
          glaciers buried northern habitats
          in a mile of ice, Appalchia
          served as the “seedbed” of
          North America, repopulating
          a desolate landscape with its
          abundant genetic stores. These
          “mixed mesophytic forests” are
          the most biodiverse temperate
          forests in the world!</p>
          <p>The mountains are also home
          to the headwaters of the major
          rivers of the eastern seaboard
          and the midwest. The water that
          flows from the taps of Atlanta
          and Washington originates here
          in the mountains, where it’s purified
          by underground coal seams.</p>

          The Appalachians are also amazingly special because of
          their unique, layered human history. And whether our
          ancestors were indigenous Cherokee or belonged to
          some very different place, somewhere in all our family
          histories are folks who knew how to live in a seasonal
          way in a cyclical world. Seen here planting seeds among
          the leaf litter of past seasons, these Grey Squirrels know
          that new life regenerates from death, and that all energy
          cycles.
          Healthy soil,
          the foundation
          of life,
          is built over
          generations
          from layers
          of composting
          detritus.

          People have
          migrated
          through
          Appalachia for
          millenia, from
          First Nations
          folks to people
          escaping enslavement.
          Seen here crash-landing in the
          boughs of an American Chestnut tree
          are European Starlings, echos of
          the Scots-Irish workers and
          farmers who fled political
          oppression in Europe in small
          numbers to resettle as self-reliant
          homesteaders in the Appalachians.
          They carry the cultural and ideological
          baggage of all migrating peoples - religion
          and language, agricultural practices and
          crops, music, tools &amp; weapons, and the
          next generation.

          An ancestral
          hoe-down infuses
          the night with footstompin’
          energy, as the Appalachian
          dulcimer joins an
          African gourd banjo and a
          Cherokee drum in a riotous
          jig. These instruments are
          the grandparents of contemporary
          mountain music.

          Survival in the pre-industrial
          world meant resourcefulness,
          thrift, reusing old
          materials, and taking only
          what you could carry. Appalachian
          communities
          relied on their neighbors and
          on the food and fuel they
          could harvest themselves,
          much like the fishing Heron,
          the timbering &amp; building
          Beaver, and the gathering
          and gardening Snails (with
          their nutritous crop of corn,
          beans and squash). Folks
          used and changed the land
          to meet their needs, but they
          did so within the land’s
          ability to replenish itself.

          Amphibian characters,
          whose permeable skin
          makes them extra-sensitive
          to their surroundings, are
          sharing a meal of wildcrafted
          Ramps (a savory
          root vegetable), Chestnuts,
          and Morel Mushrooms with
          other forest dwellers!
